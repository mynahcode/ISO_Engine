# ISO_Engine
IsoEngine is meant to be a modified version of the Hazel Engine and Hazelnut Editor by YouTuber and developer TheCherno (located here: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) tailored specifically for 2D/3D isometric game development. 
The incremental development I'm doing for this engine is loosely followed along with the tutorial for designing a game engine made by TheCherno, but I intend to design the third-party features by myself as much as reasonably possible; for example, instead of using the spdlog library for a logging system, I decided to create my own simple thread-safe logger. On top of this, as apart of supporting my learning of C++, now that I have added quite a few of my own features and implementations, I feel that I am ready to move off from the tutorials and continue the development of the modded engine myself.
This project is purely intended to re-teach myself game design principles as well as learning C++ core concepts and best practices. The "game" that is apart of the project is simply a test game and does not have any gameplay. I intend to remove the game from the repository and make a game with my engine myself after I feel that I am satisfied with the progress of my game engine and editor.
