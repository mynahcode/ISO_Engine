# ISO_Engine
IsoEngine is currently intended to be relatively rudimentary game engine meant to support Isometric 2D graphics with 3D rendering
similar to the engine created in Java for the PC game Project Zomboid. 
The incremental development I'm doing for this engine is loosely followed along with the tutorial for designing a game engine made
by YouTuber TheCherno, but I intend to design the third-party features by myself as much as reasonably possible; for example, instead
of using the spdlog library for a logging system, I decided to create my own simple thread-safe logger. On top of this,
as apart of supporting my learning of C++, I decided to do most of the refactoring of the engine to the newest standards of C++ myself
as much as I possibly can with limited external resources. Meaning once I am finished with the YouTube series tutorial of designing the
engine, or at least once I feel that I am satisfied with its development, I will develop and refactor the rest completely on my own and
not look at repository for TheCherno's current implementation of their engine "Hazel." This project is purely intended to re-teach myself
game design principles as well as learning C++ core concepts and is not intended to create a game that is for profit unless I make very
substantial progress and new features.
